# basic-python-test-project

This project is a basic python project for making sure I remember 
how to make CLI tools for DevOps using Python

## Building Scripts

To be able to use the scripts in this project as CLI tools, 
enter the following command at the root directory: 
    python3 setup.py install
This compiles the scripts to Bytecode, and places these Bytecode 
files in the /usr/local/bin directory
